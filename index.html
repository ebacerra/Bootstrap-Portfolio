              <p class="text-muted">Hello there! Here's a little something about my background. It has been a long journey of what we called "Life"
                for me. Came across so many variations of obstacles growing up. When I was 9 years old, my sister and I migrated
                here in Chicago from the Philippines to be with our father and to have a "better" life. Our childhood was
                not made easy and didn't have a normal upbringing which made it a bit of a challenge for my sister and me.</p>
              <p class="text-muted">I have learned to earn money and learned how to work hard in order to survive in this world! I have learned
                that in order to get what you want, you have to be determined and motivated. Things are not always going
                to be easy and peachy but You are the only person that can change your future so it does not stop here. With
                a design background, I am here in hopes to expand my knowledge in technology and to become more marketable
                in this growing IT world business! Hope you enjoy this short story of mine! </p>
